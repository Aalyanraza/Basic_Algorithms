## ArrayBasics

The `ArrayBasics` class provides basic operations over one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays. It includes methods for finding maximum and minimum values, swapping elements, shifting arrays, creating random arrays, and more.

## WarehouseAlgorithm

The `WarehouseAlgorithm` class contains algorithms related to warehouse management. It includes methods for determining whether there is a close pair of boxes fulfilling an order and maximizing profit from selling oil barrels.

## MaximizeProfit

The `maximizeProfit` function optimizes profit for selling oil barrels to potential buyers. It takes into account the number of barrels available, buyer orders, prices, and storage costs.

## MergeBookingSchedules

The `mergeBookingSchedules` function merges booking schedules for room reservations, ensuring that all talk requests are accommodated efficiently.

## MakeBookingSchedules

The `makeBookingSchedules` function creates booking schedules based on room availability and talk requests.
